      A dynamic system is an ordinary differential equation with several
      spacial dimensions. These examples are all first order equations in two
      spacial dimensions, which means the position of a point completely
      determines its velocity.

    <pre>
      x'(t) = fx(x(t), y(t), t)
      y'(t) = fy(x(t), y(t), t)
    </pre>

      You can think of the the field being a flow of water. We are going to
      drop some motes of dust into the water and watch where they flow. This is
      not a great analogy because water is not very compressible, and these
      flows are.

      The first few examples are quite simple. The last one shows some
      interesting behavior. Scroll to the bottom for some recommended reading.

      See <a href="fields.html">Fields</a> for the sample fields drawn by this
      program.  See <a href="controls.html">Controls</a> for how to use the
      program.
