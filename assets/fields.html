    <h2>Demo Fields</h2>
    <p>
      Here is the list of vector fields shown. I recommend you look at them in
      order.
    </p>

    <h3>Simple rotation</h3>
    <p>
      This is a simple clockwise rotation.
    </p>

    <pre>
      x' =     y + p*saw(x)
      y' = -x    + p*saw(y)
    </pre>
    <p>
      Or in vector notation
    </p>

    <pre>
      v' = [ 0  1]v  + perturbation
           [-1  0]

      v = [x]
          [y]
    </pre>
    <p>
      The perterbation is a sawtooth that depends on the parater. Add a few
      motes to the flow and clock "play". You should see them flowing in a
      clockwise circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Increase the size of the parameter and the motes will slightly deviate
      from their previous paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turn on the checkbox "Fld" to show the vector field. Because the vector
      field is bounded, the path of each mote is smooth and it is completely
      determined by the mote's starting point. That means the motes can never
      intersect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turn on the checkbox "Iso" to dissplay the isoclines. These are the
      curves where the vector field that is 0 in either the x or y component.
      If <code>x' = 0</code> then the vector field is vertical and the mote is
      traveling vertically.  If <code>y' = 0</code> then the vector field is
      horizontal and the mote is traveling horizontally. If both are 0 then the
      mote is stationary. This is also called a stationary point of the dynamic
      system.
    </p>


    <h3>Spiral - stable versus unstable point</h3>
    <p>
      We change the previous example by adding a linear dependency of
      <code>x'</code> on <code>x</code> and <code>y'</code> on <code>y</code>.
      Like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
      x' = p*x +   y
      y' =  -x + p*y
    </pre>
    <p>
      When you start out, <code>p = 0</code>, so it is identical to the
      rotation above. There is a stationary point at the center
      <code>(0,0)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the parameter to the left so that <code>p &lt; 0</code>. The motes
      will start to spiral toward the stationary point. This is a stable
      stationary point. Motes that start near the stationary point will stay
      near the stationary point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Move the parameter to the right so that <code>p > 0</code>. The motes
      will start to spiral away from the stationary point. This is an unstable
      stationary point. Motes that start near the stationary point will
      eventually move away from the stationary point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at the regions separated by the isoclines. In each region, the motes
      tend to move "up and left", "up and right", "down and left" or "down and
      right".
    </p>

    <h3>Stir</h3>
    <p>
      Here is an example with several stationary points. Some are stable and
      some are unstable. Notice that if you add a mote near one of the unstable
      points it drifts away and then starts to approach the stable points.
    </p>

    <pre>
      x' = -0.2 x^3 + saw(y, y_cent)
      y' = -0.2 y^3 - saw(x, x_cent)
                              /
                         /\  /
       saw(x,c) =       /  \/
                       /

    </pre>
    <p>
      Change the paremeter and the stationary points will start to move. The
      motes will start to follow. You end up with a chaotic mess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the equations are smooth, motes that start near each other, will
      in the short term, stay near each other. However, if you wait long enough
      they will eventually drift apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is seems like a paradox of calculus: if you fix a value of
      <code>t</code>, then the position <code>(x(t), y(t))</code> varies
      continuously with respect to <code>(x(0), y(0))</code>. But if you do not
      fix <code>t</code>, and let it grow large, then you loose that
      continuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This example is a little bit interesting because there is an attractor
      that moves with time. But it's not very interesting: eventually all the
      motes end up spiralling closely around one of the four attractor points.
    </p>

    <h3>Chaotic System w/Strange Attract</h3>
    <p>
      This is an example from the book mentioned in the reference section
      below.
    </p>

    <pre>
      x'(t) = 0.7y + 10x(0.1-y^2)
      y'(t) = -x + 0.25 sin(1.57t)
    </pre>
    <p>
      Although this system is chaotic, it has an attractor. Notice that the
      attractor is not really a curve. As time advances, the attractor
      separates and folds on itself. The motes will drift apart and then drift
      back together but in a different order.
    </p>

    <p>
      Add a grid of motes and watch how the similar colors stay near each other
      at first, and then start to mix together. It is reminiscent of kneading
      bread or forging steel.
    </p>
